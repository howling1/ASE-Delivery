# ASE-Delivery
A pick-up station delivery service (ASE Delivery). In this system, each customer who orders items is assigned a box at a pick-up station. The service then delivers the items from a central depot to the customerâ€™s box at the pick-up stations. There are three user roles in ASE Delivery: dispatchers, deliverers, and customers. Dispatchers are re- sponsible for the management of pick-up boxes and deliveries. Deliverers transport deliveries to the pick-up box assigned to a customer. Finally, Customers collect their delivery from their box. To verify if a deliverer or customer can unlock a box, each deliverer and customer is given an RFID tag for identification. Each pick-up box has an RFID scanner to read the RFID tag from a deliverer or customer and determine if they are authorized to unlock the box. The Customers are informed when their delivery is created, delivered, or picked up successfully. The following figure depicts the workflow of the delivery system.
